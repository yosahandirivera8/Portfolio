    <p> Hi I'm Yosahandi Rivera,
        
        I am currently an undergraduate Cognitive Science student at the University of California, San Diego with a minor in Computer Science. I explore the connection between applying computation methods to study human cognition. I mainly focus on Python and Java programming languages, however to name a few other skills I also work on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. I use these languages to study human-computer interaction, where I am extremley interested in continuing to learn and understand how to improve user experience and solve real-world problems using a mix of cognitive science and computer science principles. Please feel free to check out my personal projects linked above and don't hesitate to contact me!!  </p>
